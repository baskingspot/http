## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `encoding.negotiate`: `Accept-Encoding` parsing and content-coding
  negotiation over the q-value, wildcard, and identity rules. The chosen
  token is borrowed from the caller's supported list.
- `encoding.negotiateFields`: the same negotiation across multiple field
  lines, which combine as one ordered list.
- `token_list.contains` and `token_list.iterator`: comma-separated token
  lists such as `Connection` and `Upgrade`, with OWS handling and
  case-insensitive membership.
- `content_length.parse`: `Content-Length` parsing and duplicate
  combination. Conflicting values, non-digits, and overflow are errors;
  `null` means the field was absent.

### Changed

- The package depends on `baskingspot/stdx` for `stdx.fmt.atoi`;
  `content_length` parses its digits with it.
